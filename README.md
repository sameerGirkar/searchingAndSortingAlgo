  1. Bubble Sort - Time complexity O(n^2)
  2. Selection Sort - Time complexity O(n^2)
  3. Insertion Sort - Time complexity O(n^2)
  4. Merge Sort - Time complexity O(n * log(n))
  5. Quick Sort - Time complexity => T(n)= n + 2 T(n/2) => O(n * log(n))
  6. Heap Sort - Time complexity O(n * log(n)) but detailed analysis prove its O(n)
